# rvest_tutorial
A look at web scraping in R!

To get ready for the workshop:
* Before you begin the workshop, download a fresh copy of this repo, since I will be doing some minor bug fixes beforehand.
* Make sure that you can run all of the functions in the 'setup' R Markdown file.

All materials will be in the R Markdown files.
